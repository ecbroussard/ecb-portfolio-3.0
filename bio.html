			<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>I grew up in Pride, La., a tiny town in East Baton Rouge Parish. In 2002, I graduated from Redemptorist High School in Baton Rouge and began my undergraduate studies at the Louisiana Scholars' College at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, La. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism in 2006 and worked as a newspaper reporter and copy editor. In 2009, I returned to academia and entered an alternative certification program for secondary teachers. In 2010, I graduated with a Master of Arts in teaching from Louisiana State University.</p>
					<p>I spent five years as a high school English and journalism teacher, but I began to desire a career shift back into the media/communications field. In preparation for this transtition, I began taking night classes at Tulane University's School of Continuing Studies, and I earned a post-baccalaureate certificate (equivalent to a second bachelor's degree) in digital design in 2014. I currently work for an education-based publishing company in Baton Rouge, La., as a layout editor and proofreader. I am also pursuing a master's degree in web design from the University of Florida by taking online classes at night. After graduating in December 2018, I plan to pursue jobs in multimedia journalism and web design.</p>
					<p>In my private life, I divide my free time between the Baton Rouge and New Orleans areas. My favorite recreational activities include listening to audiobooks, scouring the Internet for unique recipes to try at home, singing karaoke, playing board games, and debating politics.
